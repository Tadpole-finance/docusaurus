## Introduction

Tadpole Finance is an open source platform providing decentralized finance services for saving and lending. Tadpole Finance creates a more open lending market, where users can make deposits and loans with any ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network.

Tadpole Finance is a DeFi lending protocol. In more technical terms, it's an algorithmic money market protocol. You could think of it as an open marketplace for money. It lets users deposit cryptocurrencies and earn interest, or borrow other cryptoassets against them. It uses smart contracts that automate the storage and management of the capital being added to the platform. 

What distinguishes Tadpole from other DeFi projects is that anyone can register any ERC-20 token with Tadpole into the lending protocol. Once a token is registered on the market, people can send some deposits into the protocol to earn interest or borrow the token by placing certain collateral and paying some interest.
